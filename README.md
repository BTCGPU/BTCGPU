# Bitcoin Gold

## This is a no-premine client for Bitcoin Gold

The Bitcoin Gold developers decided to include a premine at: https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU

You can see the change here:
https://github.com/realBitcoinGold/BTCGPU/commit/623ec59bb35bd4f20031506a4314e45a1d53fa6f

It will be up to the miners to decide what client to use.  If 51% of miners use the no-premine client, there will be no premine for Bitcoin Gold.

## FAQ

Q: Is this a fork of Bitcoin Gold?

A: No, it is an alternative client.  If 51%+ (majority) of miners use the no-premine chain, there will be no premine.  If the majority of miners want a premine, they can use the premine chain and get a premine.

Q: Why should miners want a premine in Bitcoin Gold?

A: Use the premine chain if you want developers to get a premine.  Maybe it will incentivize them to work on the chain and make it more valuable.

Q: What if I try to mine blocks with the no-premine client, but more mining power wants a premine?

A: Your mined blocks will be invalid and forked off the main chain.  The same is true if you try mining with the pre-mine chain and the majority wants no-premine.

Bitcoin Gold (codename BTCGPU) is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that will occur at block height 491407, at roughly 12:00:00 UTC October 25, 2017.

At the predetermined block height, Bitcoin Gold miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and this will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. The new branch is a distinct blockchain with the same transaction history as Bitcoin up until the fork, but then diverges from it. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency will be born.

## WARNING

Bitcoin Gold is a work in progress. If you don’t understand what you are doing, please don’t compile and run your own client from the staging tree. Your own client will **NOT WORK**. However, you're more than welcome to help test the code and join the development.
