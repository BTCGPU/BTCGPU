# Bitcoin 2X

Bitcoin 2X (codename Bitcoin2X) is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that will occur at block height 494784, at roughly 12:00:00 UTC November 16, 2017.

At the predetermined block height, Bitcoin2X miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and this will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue on unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. The new branch is a distinct blockchain with the same transaction history as Bitcoin up until the fork, but then diverges from it. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency will be born.

 this project name is BitcoinX, tading code: BTX
